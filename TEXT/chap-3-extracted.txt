METHODOLOGY
3.1 Agile Scrum Methodology in the Project
Agile Scrum is an iterative project management framework that structures work into time-boxed sprints typically spanning two to four weeks to deliver incremental value, accommodate evolving requirements, and prioritize stakeholder input. Within public consultation initiatives, this approach facilitates adaptable design, enables responsive action to community needs, and ensures ongoing alignment with policy objectives, effectively addressing the dynamic character of public engagement and the diversity of stakeholder expectations..

3.3 Sprint Cycles
Sprint cycles include participation into every phase of project development, allowing for quick adjustments and guaranteeing that community voices influence results in real time, in contrast to typical linear consultation, which frequently gathers input only at specific milestones. Addressing gaps such as delayed feedback loops, low public trust, and a mismatch between government plans and community demands is the main objective

Figure no. 4 Communication Pattern for Microservices
Here’s the communication pattern diagram for an e-commerce microservices system:
		🔵 Blue solid lines → Synchronous (Request/Response) calls (e.g., login, product search, payment validation).
		🟢 Green dashed lines → Asynchronous (Event-driven) interactions (e.g., order triggers stock updates, shipping, notifications).

Dfd level 1

3.6 DevOps Implementation 
DevOps combines IT operations (Ops) with software development (Dev) to improve collaboration, expedite delivery, and increase the dependability of public consultation platforms. It uses techniques like infrastructure as code (IaC), continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and automated monitoring to meet the particular requirements of government-led engagement tools, such as scalability, security, transparency, and adherence to public sector rules.

Figure no. 6 CI/CD Pipeline

Figure no. 7 Infrastructure as a Code (IaC)

Public consultation focuses on tangible infrastructure outcomes, but IaC initiatives require addressing technical design choices that impact accessibility, security, transparency, and community trust. This research examines how to integrate public input into IaC-driven projects, ensuring technical decisions align with public needs while maintaining IaC’s efficiency benefits..

Figure no. 8 Monitoring and Alerting
M&A focuses on technical metrics, but public consultation ensures these systems prioritize community-relevant outcomes—such as service accessibility during peak engagement, data privacy protections, or timely alerts for issues affecting marginalized groups. This research examines how integrating public input into M&A design, implementation, and operation enhances transparency, accountability, and alignment with public needs.

3.7 Integration Approach for Information Systems
The Integration approaches for public consultation information systems aim to connect disparate tools, data sources, and stakeholder platforms into a cohesive ecosystem. This ensures seamless flow of information, consistent user experiences, and unified analysis of public input critical for effective decision-making in government and public sector organizations.

Figure no. 9 Business Process Architecture

Figure no. 10 API Gateway
API gateways are traditionally designed for technical efficiency and security, public consultation ensures these systems prioritize community needs such as accessibility, transparency, equitable data access, and trust. This research examines how integrating public input into API gateway design, deployment, and governance enhances usability, accountability, and alignment with public priorities.

Figure no. 11 Data Flow Diagram
DFDs are traditionally designed for technical and compliance purposes, public consultation ensures these diagrams reflect community concerns about data privacy, transparency, equity, and accountability. This research examines how integrating public input into DFD design, validation, and communication enhances trust in data handling processes and ensures alignment with public values.

Figure no. 12 Use Case Diagram
Use case diagrams are traditionally designed for technical and functional planning, public consultation ensures these diagrams prioritize community needs such as accessibility, equity, transparency, and user-centricity. This research examines how integrating public input into use case diagram design, validation, and communication enhances system usability, ensures inclusive engagement, and builds trust in public services.

Figure no. 13 Sequence Diagram
Sequence diagrams are traditionally used for technical process planning and troubleshooting, public consultation ensures these diagrams prioritize community needs such as transparency, timeliness, equity, and clarity of communication. This research examines how integrating public input into sequence diagram design, validation, and communication enhances process accountability, ensures inclusive engagement, and builds trust in how public consultation activities are executed.

Figure no. 14 Flowchart
Flow charts are traditionally designed for operational efficiency and compliance, public consultation ensures these diagrams prioritize community needs such as clarity, equity, accessibility, and transparency. This research examines how integrating public input into flow chart design, validation, and communication enhances process understanding, ensures inclusive participation, and builds trust in how public institutions operate.

3.8 Introduction to TOGAF and the Four Architectural Domains  
The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) is a vendor-neutral, flexible framework for designing and governing enterprise architectures. When applied to public consultation initiatives—whether for government policies, infrastructure projects, or digital services—TOGAF provides a structured approach to align consultation processes with organizational goals, community needs, and regulatory requirements. It ensures public engagement is holistic, scalable, and adaptable to diverse stakeholder groups, while maintaining transparency and accountability.

1. Business Architecture
Defines the purpose, governance, and processes of public consultation, aligning them with organizational and community objectives.
2. Data Architecture
Defines how feedback data and stakeholder information is collected, stored, managed, and shared.
3. Application Architecture
Defines the tools and systems used to support public consultation activities and integrate feedback into organizational workflows.
4. Technology Architecture
Defines the technical infrastructure that supports consultation applications and data systems.delivery of engagement services while aligning with business, data, and application architecture goal.
